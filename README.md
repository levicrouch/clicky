# clicky

## Overview:
[Clicky-guy]("https://clicky-guy.herokuapp.com/") is a front-end react game similar to the children's game [Memory]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)"). The player will see 9 images of Family Guy characters. The player clicks an image and earns a point for every click on a unique image. If the player clicks an image twice, the round is over.

## Technical Notes:
Uses [React.js]("https://reactjs.org/") on the front end to render the page along with each component:
- Navbar
- image tiles

The application also uses [materialize]("http://materializecss.com/") for the styling.
